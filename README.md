My Burger App!

This is my burger app made using Sequelize. To use my burger app you will need to add in your own burger to the list of burgers on the left to be devoured. To do so type in the name of your burger in the text box and click submit; your burger will appear in the list. Click the corresponding Devour It button to devour the button which will move it to the right side.

Enjoy your burgers!




Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
